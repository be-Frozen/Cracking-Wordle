# Cracking Wordle: Predicting Wordle Results

## Overview

Wordle Predictor is a project that offers a comprehensive analysis and prediction of Wordle game results. Wordle is a popular online word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. This project aims to predict the number of reported results on a future date, the associated percentage of scores, and categorize the difficulty of a word in the game.

We won a **Meritorious Winner** in the 2023 MCM/ICM competition!

## Key Features

- Predict future Wordle game results.
- Categorize the difficulty of guessing words.
- Three prediction models: Prophet, Multilayer Perceptron, and K-Means Clustering.
- Innovative algorithm called Normal Distribution Principle Components Analysis for accuracy.
- Detailed explanation of results and model accuracy.

## Usage

To use Wordle Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/wordle-predictor.git`
3. Run the prediction models and analysis.

Detailed usage instructions can be found in the project's documentation or PDF solution.

## Models

Wordle Predictor employs three models:

1. **Prophet**: A forecasting tool.
2. **Multilayer Perceptron**: A neural network model.
3. **K-Means Clustering**: A clustering algorithm.

These models use characteristic values extracted from word attributes to predict Wordle game results and difficulty.
